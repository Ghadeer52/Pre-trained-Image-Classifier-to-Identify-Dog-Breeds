Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
The classifications is defferent  among the three model architectures.
- The VGG model classified it as a shih-tzu.
- The ResNet model classified it as a Japanese spaniel.
- The AlexNet model also classified it as a Japanese spaniel.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, each of the three model architectures did not classify Dog_01.jpg to be the same as Dog_02.jpg.
- VGG model classified Dog_01.jpg as a shih-tzu, while Dog_02.jpg was classified as a Japanese spaniel.
- ResNet model classified Dog_01.jpg as a Japanese spaniel, while Dog_02.jpg was classified as a shih-tzu.
- AlexNet model classified Dog_01.jpg as a Japanese spaniel, while Dog_02.jpg was classified as a shih-tzu.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, the three models correctly classified them to not be dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine which model performed the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Since all three models had similar results and did not show a clear advantage over one another.if the runtime is a crucial factor to consider, the AlexNet model could be selected as the best for uploaded image classification. This model had the shortest run time of 1 second.
